a) Link to application: INSERT URL TO DEPLOYED APPLICATION

b) User instructions: Click on the link found in part (a) of this readme in order to access the application. Once you enter the site, you may log in by clicking the LOGIN button on the top right corner of the website. After clicking the button you must enter your valid username and password. At the center of the front page, you will see three options of hardware sets that you can choose from. Once you select one of them, you can see further details on each one as the card flips over. On the left top corner of the page, one can click on an icon with three horizontal bars in order to switch to another page within the website. These pages are not created at the moment, but will soon allow the user to access the Hardware Sets page, Data Sets page, and the Contact Us page. This is how the user should navigate the website. 

c) Some issues to be aware of:
	- As of now, some buttons do not work when pressed. This will not be the case for Checkpoint 3.
